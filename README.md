# Neural Network (Back-Propagation) in Unity 3D

> Unity version: 2018.3.0f2

Neural network in Unity 3D trained with Back-Propagation, to recognize handwritten digits from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data set.

## Implementaci√≥n
The neural network implementation was done by following this very good tutorial [Neural Network - Back-Propagation Tutorial In C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_PByyJ9g-I&t=2428s).

## Future work
* Save the model in a binary file.
* Drawing tool for testing with your own digits drawings.
